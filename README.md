# borntorun

Basic website to play around with some bootstrap and css styles.

The website is meant to mimic a runners website including upcoming events, results finder and gear reviews.

TODO
- Add Angular CLI
- Break the index page into different components
- Create a backend to hold data (not sure what backend - Express? MongoDB? Azure?)
